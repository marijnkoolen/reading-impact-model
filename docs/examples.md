# Example Sentences

[Back to README](../)

To illustrate what we mean by affective impact, we have selected some examples and described the affective impact we think they express. Some of the sentences we present you with during the questionnaire may merely describe an aspect of the book, while others go into the reader’s affective experience of reading. We ask you to judge whether a specific sentence contains an element of affective response or not. Keep in mind that these judgements are subjective and differences of opinion are possible. These differences of opinion are important for us to distinguish between cases of very clear affective impact and more dubious impact.


#### Example Sentence 1

- "The book begins with the introduction of Juliet, an author looking for her next subject to write about."

This sentence contains a description of the plot without saying anything about the reading experience. It does not describe affective impact. It explains some of the events from the story without assessment or reflection from the reviewer.

#### Example Sentence 2

- "I enjoyed the book for the most part."

This sentence indicates positive affective response because it uses a positive word, <i>“enjoyed,”</i> to describe the book overall.

#### Example Sentence 3

- "I enjoyed the characters, and I found the history of Guernsey so interesting I would love to visit there someday. "

This sentence indicates narrative feeling, because the reviewer describes an affective response <i>“enjoyed”</i>, to parts of the narrative: <i>“characters”</i> and <i>“the history of Guernsey.”</i>

#### Example Sentence 4

- "What I didn't enjoy was the epistolary form the book took."

This sentence indicates stylistic feeling, because the reviewer attributes an affective response <i>“didn’t enjoy”</i> to a stylistic feature of the book: the epistolary form. This sentence also scores in the category of negative impact, because the reviewer expresses a negative response to that element from the book.

#### Example Sentence 5

- "This book made me think about things I’ve never considered."

This sentence indicates reflection because the reviewer’s view of some part of the book or the world has changed.

#### Example Sentence 6

- "A light-hearted novel that will make you laugh out loud with its irrepressible humour, awkward situations and characters you just can't stop loving."

This sentence indicates humor as well as narrative feeling because the book made the reviewer laugh and the reviewer had an emotional response, <i> “loving”</i> to a narrative element of the book, namely the characters.

#### Example Sentence 7

- "I read this book in one go, staying up until late at night just so I could finish it. ."

This sentence indicates attention because the reader’s focus on the book lasted for a long time.

#### Example Sentence 8

- "There is a great unexpected twist at the end."

This sentence indicates surprise, <i>“unexpected twist”</i> as well as positive affective response: <i>“great”</i>.
