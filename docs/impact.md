# Reading Impact

[Back to README](https://github.com/marijnkoolen/reading-impact-model)

In this study, we differentiate between eight types of (mostly
affective) impact. By “affect” we mean the same thing as “emotion” or
“feeling.”

To illustrate what we mean by (affective) impact, we have selected some
examples and described the impact we think they express. Some sentences
in the questionnaire may merely describe an aspect of the book, while
others go into the reader’s affective experience of reading. 

The types of impact are:

**Attention**: the reader's feeling of concentration or focus on his or
her reading.

Example Sentence: *"I read this book in
one go, staying up until late at night just so I could finish it."*

This sentence indicates attention because the reader’s focus on the book
lasted for a long time.

**Positive feeling**: any positive emotional response to the book during
or after reading. A feeling is positive if it contributes to a positive
reading experience, so even sad or awful events can contribute to a
positive affective response.

Example Sentence Positive Feeling: *"I enjoyed the book for the most part."* 


This sentence indicates positive affective response because it uses a
positive word, *“enjoyed,”* to describe the book overall.


**Narrative feeling**: a subcategory of positive feeling,
specifically response to the narrative properties of a book. This
includes feelings about storylines, characters, scenes or elements
of the storyworld.

Example Sentence Narrative Feeling: 
*"I enjoyed the characters, and I found the history of Guernsey so
interesting I would love to visit there someday. "* 

This sentence indicates narrative feeling, because the reviewer
describes an affective response *“enjoyed”*, to parts of the
narrative: *“characters”* and *“the history of Guernsey.”*

**Stylistic feeling**: a subcategory of positive feeling,
specifically response to the stylistic properties of a text such as
feelings of admiration or defamiliarization about its tone, choice
of words, use of metaphor or the way the sentences flow.


Example Sentence Stylistic Feeling: <span classname="sentence-text">
*"This is one of, if not the most, beautifully written books I have
ever read."* </span>


This sentence indicates stylistic feeling, because the reviewer
clearly experiences positive affect (*“beautiful”*) as a result of a
stylistic feature (*“written”*) of the book.


**Humor**: a subcategory of positive feeling. An emotional response
of laughter, smiling or amusement; the effect of any type of humor
in the text.


Example Sentence Humor: <span classname="sentence-text"> *"A
light-hearted novel that will make you laugh out loud with its
irrepressible humour, awkward situations and characters you just
can't stop loving."* </span>


This sentence indicates humor as well as narrative feeling because
the book made the reviewer laugh and the reviewer had an emotional
response, *“loving”* to a narrative element of the book, namely the
characters.


**Surprise**: a feeling of surprise at some element of the book, perhaps
a plot development, part of the storyworld or a stylistic feature.


Example Sentence Surprise: <span classname="sentence-text"> *"There is a
great unexpected twist at the end."* </span>


This sentence indicates both surprise (*“unexpected twist”*) and a
positive affective response: *“great”*.

**Negative feeling**: feelings of dislike or disapproval towards any
element of the book. This could mean an dislike for a storyline or
character or a feeling of boredom or frustration with the book as a
whole. Keep in mind that a reviewer can have read about events that are
awful in themselves without having a negative feeling of the storyline
itself.


Example Sentence Negative Feeling: <span classname="sentence-text">
*"What I didn't enjoy was the epistolary form the book took."* </span>


This sentence indicates negative feeling because the reviewer *"didn't
enjoy"* the form of the book.

**Reflection**: any response to a reading experience that has made the
reader reflect on something from the book, such as a theme or topic, or
on something from their own world.


Example Sentence Reflection: <span classname="sentence-text"> *"This
book made me think about things I’ve never considered."* </span>


This sentence indicates reflection because the reviewer’s view of some
part of the book or the world has changed.

No Impact Example Sentence: <span classname="sentence-text"> "The book
begins with the introduction of Juliet, an author looking for her next
subject to write about." </span>


This sentence contains a description of the plot without saying anything
about the reading experience. It does not describe (affective) impact.
It explains some of the events from the story without assessment or
reflection from the reviewer.

We are aware that these categories are difficult to define and can
sometimes overlap.
